# Introduction to uBPF Backend

The **p4c-ubpf** compiler allows to translate P4 programs into the uBPF programs. We use the uBPF implementation provided 
by [the P4rt-OVS switch](https://github.com/Orange-OpenSource/p4rt-ovs). The uBPF VM is based on the
open-source implementation provided by [IOVisor](https://github.com/iovisor/ubpf).

The P4-to-uBPF compiler accepts only the P4_16 programs written for the [ubpf_model.p4](../ubpf/p4include/ubpf_model.p4) architecture model.

The backend for uBPF is mostly based on [P4-to-eBPF compiler](../ebpf/README.md). In fact, it implements the same concepts, but
generates C code, which is compatible with the user space BPF implementation. 

## Background

### P4

Please, refer to [the overview of P4 written in eBPF Backend](../ebpf#p4).

### uBPF

**Why uBPF?** The uBPF Virtual Machine can be used in any solution implementing the kernel bypass (e.g. DPDK apps).

The uBPF project re-implements the [eBPF](../ebpf#ebpf) kernel-based Virtual Machine. While the BPF programs are 
intented to run in the kernel, the uBPF project enables running the BPF programs in user-space applications. It contains 
eBPF assembler, disassembler, interpreter, and JIT compiler for x86-64.

Moreover, contrary to the eBPF implementation, uBPF is not licensed under GPL. The uBPF implementation is licensed under
Apache License, version 2.0. 

## Compiling P4 to uBPF

The scope of the uBPF backend is wider than the scope of the eBPF backend. Except for simple packet filtering the 
P4-to-uBPF compiler supports also P4 registers and programmable actions including packet's modifications and tunneling. For further details
refer to [uBPF architecture model](p4include/ubpf_model.p4).

The current version of the P4-to-uBPF compiler translates P4_16 programs to programs written in the C language. This
program is compatible with the uBPF VM and the `clang` compiler can be used to generate uBPF bytecode.

### Translation between P4 and C

We follow the convention of the P4-to-eBPF compiler so the parser translation is presented in the table 
[Translating parsers](../ebpf#translating-parsers) from P4-to-eBPF. The translation of match-action pipelines is presented
in the [Translating match-action pipelines](../ebpf#translating-match-action-pipelines) table from P4-to-eBPF.

However, we introduced some modifications, which are listed below:

* The generated code uses user-level data types (e.g. uint8_t, etc.). 
* Methods to extract packet fields (e.g. load_dword, etc.) have been re-implemented to use user-space data types.
* The uBPF helpers are imported into the C programs.
* We have added `mark_to_drop()` extern to the `ubpf` model, so that packets to drop are marked in the P4-native way.
* We have added support for P4 registers implemented as BPF maps

### How to use?

The sample P4 programs are located in `examples/` directory. We have tested them with the [P4rt-OVS](https://github.com/Orange-OpenSource/p4rt-ovs) switch - 
the Open vSwitch that can be extended with BPF programs at runtime. See [the detailed tutorial](./docs/EXAMPLES.md) on how to run and test those examples.

In order to generate the C code use the following command:

`p4c-ubpf PROGRAM.p4 -o out.c`

This command will generate out.c and the corresponding out.h file containing definitions of the packet structures and BPF maps.

Once the C program is generated it can be compiled using:

`clang -O2 -target bpf -c out.c -o /tmp/out.o`

The output file (`out.o`) can be injected to the uBPF VM. 

#### Custom C extern functions

The P4 to uBPF compiler allows to define custom C extern functions and call them from P4 program as P4 action.

The design of this feature is identical to `p4c-ebpf`. See [the P4 to eBPF documentation](../ebpf/README.md#how-to-inject-custom-extern-function-to-the-generated-ebpf-program) 
to learn how to use this feature. Note that the C extern function written for `p4c-ubpf` must be compatible with userspace BPF VM.

### Known limitations

* No support for some P4 constructs (meters, counters, etc.)
