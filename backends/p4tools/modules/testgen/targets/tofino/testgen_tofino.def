/// An extension of TaintExpression. This class is used for variables that exhibit special behavior
/// when not initialized. For example, in Tofino, if the port variable has not been written to, the
/// packet will be dropped. However, reading from this uninitialized variable will still produce
/// taint. This behavior must be modeled. So we use this uninitialized IR class, which acts like
/// taint, but is its own type that can be checked for.
