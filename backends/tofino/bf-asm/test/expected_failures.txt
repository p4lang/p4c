- current compiler failures on some tests.

parser1.p4 compile
parser2.p4 compile
parser_dc_full.p4 compile
port_vlan_mapping.p4 compile
- glass fails to unroll parser loop properly (new problem with 3.3?)

action_chain1.p4 bfas
- asm gen fails to include 'next' field in ternary indirect

counter4.p4 mismatch
- compiler duplicates data on ixbar and programs byteswizzle to inconsistently
  pull from either copy; assembler always pulls from first.

counter5.p4 mismatch
- synth2port fabric is different -- not clear if it is a bug or where

hash_index5.p4 mismatch
- control of stats table is different

exact_match3.p4 mismatch
- vpn lsb encoding swapped (not a bug -- either way is fine)
- asm chooses different home rows for action table that needs multiple
  (compiler should specify in asm output)

exact_match5.p4 mismatch
- compiler duplicates data across ixbar groups and programs vh_xbar_select to
  pull from either copy; assembler always pulls from first.

hash_index2.p4 mismatch
hash_index3.p4 mismatch
- compiler fails to produce asm code for default action

meter_test1.p4 mismatch
- vpn lsb encoding swapped (not a bug -- either way is fine)
- synth2port fabric is different -- not clear if it is a bug or where
- idletime missing from asm?

mac_rewrite.p4 bfas
- glass generates invalid slice of immediate for action_bus.
