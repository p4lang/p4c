/**
 * Lowers `push_front` and `pop_front` primitives to a sequence of
 * `modify_field` primitives that perform the work.
 *
 * To understand how these primitives are implemented, it's important to
 * understand the data structure that's used for header stack POV bits. A header
 * stack's POV bits are organized in a sequential layout within a single
 * container, as follows (in little-endian order):
 *
 *  [ push bits ] [ entry 0 POV bit, entry 1 POV bit, ...] [ pop bits ]
 *
 * There is one POV bit per header stack entry. These bits are set to indicate
 * that a specific entry is valid. When the program writes to a specific header
 * stack index, we update the corresponding bit.  The bits are also used in the
 * deparser to decide which entries should be written into the output packet.
 * In other words, when you access a specific header stack entry, the POV bits
 * behave just as if they were the POV bits for a group of unrelated headers.
 *
 * When the program executes a `push_front` or `pop_front` primitive, we need to
 * shift all the entries over to make room for new values. These primitives
 * don't actually *set* any new values, though; they just make room. They could
 * just as well be called `shift_forward` or `shift_back`.
 *
 * The contents of the entries are shifted by copying each field from its old
 * position to its new position with `modify_field`. The POV bits also need to be
 * shifted, and that's what the "push bits" and "pop bits" are for. The push
 * bits are all set to 1 (that happens in the parser; see the StackPushShims
 * pass) and the pop bits are all set to 0.
 *
 * When you push, `modify_field` copies *from* the header stack POV container
 * *to* the same container. Consider the what happens when we execute
 * `push_front(header_stack, 2)`:
 *
 *                        [  SOURCE ]
 *  [ 1 1 .. push bits .. 1 1 ] [ 1 0 0 0 ] [ 0 0 .. pop bits .. 0 0 ]
 *                                [DEST ]
 *
 * The four bits labeled SOURCE - two 1's from the push bits, the 1 from entry
 * 0's POV bit, and the 0 from entry 1's POV bit - are copied over the four
 * entry POV bits, labeled DEST. Before the copy, only entry 0's POV bit was
 * set; after the copy, the POV bits for entry 0, 1, and 2 are set - we've
 * pushed two new, valid (because we'll immediate write to them) entries into
 * the header stack. In other words, the entry POV bits now look like this:
 *
 *  [ 1 1 1 0 ]
 *
 * It should be obvious that this will work correctly regardless of the existing
 * values of the entry POV bits. We just need to ensure that we have enough push
 * bits for the largest `push_front` operation we'll execute (that's why we
 * compute the `maxpush` and `maxpop` values) and that we overwrite all of the
 * existing entry POV bits when we do the update.
 *
 * The situation is analogous for `pop_front(header_stack, 3)`:
 *
 *                                      [  SOURCE ]
 *  [ 1 1 .. push bits .. 1 1 ] [ 1 1 1 1 ] [ 0 0 0 .. pop bits .. 0 0 ]
 *                                [DEST ]
 *
 * Here we're still overwriting all of the entry POV bits (labelled DEST). Since
 * we're popping three entries, we take three 0's from the pop bits and use only
 * a single entry POV bit, which is set to 1. The resulting entry POV bits:
 *
 *   [ 1 0 0 0 ]
 *
 * That's just what we'd expect after popping three entries.
 *
 * When writing the code to implement this, the layout is very important. The
 * MakeSlice calls below accept bit indices in little endian order, but the push
 * bits need to be positioned adjacent to the POV bit for the first entry, and
 * the pop bits need to be positioned adjacent to the POV bit for the last entry.
 * That means that as things stand, the container bit indices will be ordered
 * like this (though the specific indices will depend on the size of the header
 * stack, maxpush, and maxpop):
 *
 *  [ push bits ] [ entry 0 POV bit, entry 1 POV bit] [ pop bits ]
 *    5      4            3                2            1      0
 *
 * The numbering for the header stack entry POV bits moves in the opposite
 * direction from the numbering of the bits in the container!
 *
 * In the code, we name the field containing the push bits for `header_stack`
 * `header_stack.$push`. The pop bits are in `header_stack.$pop`. The entries
 * are in `header_stack[0].$valid` and so forth. A special field
 * `header_stack.$stkvalid` is overlaid over the *entire sequence of bits* so
 * that they can be referred to as a unit, and in practice we often manipulate
 * the other fields by writing to that one.
