/**
 * @ingroup LowerParserIR
 * @brief This pass is used to ensure that there will be no conflicting partial_hdr_err_proc
 *        at the time the LoweredParserMatch is created.
 *
 * This pass makes sure that each parser state respects the following constraints:
 *
 *      1. A state includes only extract statements in which PacketRVal have same
 *         partial_hdr_err_proc;
 *
 *      2. When a state includes both extracts and transitions, the partial_hdr_err_proc
 *         from the extracts (which are all the same according to 1.) are the same
 *         as the PacketRVal in select() statements from the next states.
 *
 * Constraint 1 is pretty simple; since there is only a single partial_hdr_err_proc
 * in the LoweredParserMatch node, two extracts must have the same setting in order
 * not to conflict.
 *
 * Constraint 2 exists because load operations issued from select statements in next
 * states are typically moved up to the current state to prepare the data for the
 * match that will occur in the next state.  The field that is referenced in these
 * select statements must have the same partial_hdr_err_proc as the extracts in the
 * current state in order not to conflict.
 *
 * States that do not respect these constraints are split in states that do, starting
 * from the ones that are further down the tree and going upwards.  When a select is
 * moved from the current state to a new state, to reduce the number of states created,
 * extracts that are compatible with that select are moved also to that new state
 * as long as the original extract order is respected.  In other words, if the compatible
 * extracts are the last ones in the current state, before the select.
