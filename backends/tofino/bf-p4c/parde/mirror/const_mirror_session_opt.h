/**
 * This pass optimizes the following code pattern:
 *  if (ig_intr_md.mirror_type == 0) {
 *      mirror.emit<HeaderType>(10w0, { ... });
 *
 * For Tofino1, mirror_id is 10b and generally expected to allocate to PHV16.
 * However, the hardware is capable of accepting PHV8 as well. When a PHV8 is
 * used, the hardware will automatically duplicate the PHV8 to PHV16 by
 * concatenating the PHV8 with itself.
 *
 * Therefore, if the mirror_id is constant 0, we can use the B0 container which
 * is reserved for deparse_zero to generate the 10b0 value for mirror_id.
 *
 * This pass can save PHV resource for the following errata implementation:
 * Due to the errata, the packet cannot be "fully" dropped in the deparser â€“
 * this will cause serious problems. Therefore, it needs to be dropped just past
 * the deparser, i.e. in that mirror component (mirroring engine). Compiler
 * provides the workaround transparently, without requiring everyone to change
 * the way they drop packets. Compiler synthesizes the code that adds packet
 * mirroring using mirror_type 0, which in turn uses mirror session 0, that is
 * reserved and is programmed by the driver to be invalid. So, if P4 program
 * handles a unicast packet (for example), and set drop_ctl=1, the device will
 * see that it still has to mirror that packet to mirror_type 0 and the packet
 * will proceed to the mirroring component. There, it will be mirrored to
 * session 0 (coming from that variable $tmp3), but since it is invalid, the
 * packet will be dropped and will not go to the TM.  As a result, if you want
 * to cancel mirroring, the proper way to do it would be to call
 * invalidate(ig_dprsr_md.mirror_type) and not to set
 * ig_dprsr_md.drop_ctl[2:2]=1.
