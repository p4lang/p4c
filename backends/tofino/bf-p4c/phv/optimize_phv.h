/**
 * Optimization Strategy called when PHV Allocation fail to place all the SuperClusters
 *
 * The Brute Force Strategy add a Transaction for each SuperClusters being assigned. This
 * Transaction list can be used to replay back the PHV Allocation found by the greedy algorithm.
 * It can also be used as a baseline to try replacing some of these transactions with others and
 * ultimately increase the whole solution score. The solution is optimized until we are either able
 * to fit all of the unassigned SuperClusters or it went over the entire transaction list for
 * MAX_OPT_PASS times.
 *
 * This is an overview of what this optimization strategy is doing:
 *
 * 1 - Take the first Transaction (a) in the list
 * 2 - Create a Transaction list (b) that excludes this Transaction (a) and all of the Transaction
 *     that was dependant (c) on that one as well
 * 3 - Play back this Transaction list (b)
 * 4 - Try to re-assign the removed Transaction (a) and all of the dependant one (c)
 * 5 - If that succeed, Try to assign the unassigned SuperClusters
 * 6 - Take the next Transaction from the list and go back to (1)
