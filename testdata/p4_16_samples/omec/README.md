# OMEC P4 Programs
The P4 programs contained here model a virtual User Plane Function (UPF) pipeline as part of the SD-Fabric project. up4.p4 is a One-Big-UPF abstraction, a program that doesn't run on switches, but is used as the schema to define the content of the P4Runtime messages that can be exchanged with the UP4 app.
They are sourced from https://github.com/omec-project/up4. For more information, please see https://docs.sd-fabric.org/master/advanced/p4-upf.html.
