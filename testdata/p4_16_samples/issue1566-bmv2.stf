# Here is a created-by-hand walkthrough of what the P4 program
# issue1566-bmv2.p4 _should_ do when it receives a packet with an
# etherType field of 0xcafe:

# cIngress call E.apply(0xcafe)
# E calls c2.apply(0xcafe)
# c2 does x = x << 1    (bit<16>) (0xcafe << 1) = 0x95fc = 38396
# c2 does c.apply(0x95fc)
# c does x = x + 1      x becomes 0x95fd = 38397
# c does stats.count(38397)
# c returns back to c2
# c2 returns back to E
# E calls c3.apply(0x95fd)
# c3 does x = x << 3    (bit<16>) (0x95fd << 3) = 0xafe8 = 45032
# c3 does c.apply(0xafe8)
# c does x= x + 1       x becomes 0xafe9 = 45033
# c does stats.count(45033)
# c returns back to c3
# c3 returns back to E
# E returns back to cIngress
# packet goes to cEgress, then deparser, with etherType modified to 0xafe9

packet 0  0000 0000 0000  0000 0000 0000  cafe
expect 0  0000 0000 0000  0000 0000 0000  afe9
