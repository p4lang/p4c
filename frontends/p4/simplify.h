/** @brief Replace complex control flow nodes with simpler ones where possible.
 * 
 * Simplify the IR in the following ways:
 *
 * 1. Remove empty statements from within parser states, actions, and block
 * statements.
 *
 * 2. Replace if statements with empty bodies with an empty statement.
 *
 * 3. Remove fallthrough switch cases that are not followed by a case with a
 * statement.
 *
 * 4. Replace switch statements that switch on a table application but have no
 * cases with a table application expression.
 *
 * 5. If a block statement is within another block or a parser state, and (a)
 * is empty, then replace it with an empty statement, or (b) does not contain
 * declarations, then move its component statements to the enclosing block.
 * 
 * 6. If a block statement in an if statement branch only contains a single
 * statement, replace the block with the statement it contains.
 *
 * @pre An up-to-date ReferenceMap and TypeMap.
