C++ (following the C++ 11 standard) is the implementation language for
the compiler.  This file contains notes on how we use C++ and conventions
we use for things that C++ does not handle well.

### Multiple virtual dispatch

C++ does not support multiple virtual dispatch, but we use it heavily in
the design of the Visitor classes for the compiler.  To support this use
(reasonably) cleanly, we use a preprocessor `ir-generator` to read the
IR classes from `.def` files and generate all the necessary boilerplate
for multiple dispatch in the IR and Visitor classes.

### Inner classes

C++ does not handle inner classes natively, so to implement an inner class,
we use a nested class with a reference member to the containing class
called `self`.

### RTTI
IR nodes and their handling code (e.g. Visitors) make extensive use of RTTI to perform type-checking and corresponding downcasting from `Node*` down to a particular implementation. C++ native RTTI as implemented in `dynamic_cast` and `typeid` built-ins is inherently slow and has lots of overhead. To circumvent this IR node classes use dedicated light-weight RTTI designed for semi-open class hierarchies. The implementation itself requires some boilerplate that is automatically generated by `ir-generator` for all IR classes from `.def`. The corresponding RTTI functionality could be accessed via `ICastable` interface from `lib/castable.h`. The lower-level RTTI implementation details are in `lib/rtti.h`. Overall, use of `dynamic_cast` and `typeid` for IR nodes is discouraged.

#### Using lightweight RTTI for other class hierarchies
Other class hierarchies besides `IR::Node` descendants could also benefit from lightweight RTTI functionality. In order to use it one needs to annotate the intended class hierarchy as follows:
  * Derive from `IR::Castable` (or lower-level `RTTI::Base`)
  * Use `DECLARE_TYPEINFO(Class, Bases..)` variadic macro to define necessary boilerplate. Here typeid will generated during the compile time. Should necessary, explicit typeid could be specified by `DECLARE_TYPEINFO(Class, TypeId, Bases...)`

One example of custom hierarchy using this RTTI implementation could be seen in `frontends/p4/typeChecking/typeConstraints.h`.

Important notes:
  * In order for RTTI to work all class hierarchy should be annotated using `DECLARE_TYPEINFO` macro.
  * The typeid values are unique only for the given class hierarchy, they are not intended to be compared across different class hierarchies (although this is always something questionable).
