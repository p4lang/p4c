/// @pre All variable declarations have unique names.
/// @pre No non-standard control flow blocks exist in the IR of @p stat (only if and switch).

/// ensure the right branch is triggered even if code is inserted between the split points.
/// Furthemore, declarations that would become invisible in the "after section" are hoisted. No
/// other provisions are made to isolate side effects that may be inserted between the split code
/// fragments.

/// @note No inspection is done for the called object of IR::MA::MethodCallStatement (except that @p
/// predicate is applied to them as for any other statement). Therefore, called functions/actions
/// are not recursively split.
