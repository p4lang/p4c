# Contribute to the P4 Compiler Project

Thank you for considering contributing to the P4 Compiler Project (P4C)! Your contributions are valuable and help improve the project for everyone. Before getting started, please take a moment to review the following guidelines.

## Contributing License
The P4 organizations uses [DCO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developer_Certificate_of_Origin) for contributions. Please take a look at our [guidelines](https://github.com/p4lang/governance/wiki/P4-DCO-Guidelines).

To sign off the last commit quickly use the `git commit --amend --signoff` command. The failing check will also include instructions on how to sign off all commits in two steps (using `git rebase HEAD~$NUM_COMMITS --signoff`). The [Developer Community DCO guide](https://github.com/src-d/guide/blob/master/developer-community/fix-DCO.md#dco-is-missing) also provides helpful tips on fixing DCO inconveniences. Setting up a commit hook in the P4C repository will automate adding the DCO signoff.
