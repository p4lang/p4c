/* P4-16 declaration of the P4 v1.0 switch model */

/* Note 1: More details about the definition of v1model architecture
 * can be found at the location below.
 *
 * https://github.com/p4lang/behavioral-model/blob/master/docs/simple_switch.md
 *
 * Note 2: There were several discussions among P4 working group
 * members in early 2019 regarding exactly how resubmit, recirculate,
 * and clone3 operations can be called anywhere in their respective
 * controls, but the values of the fields to be preserved is the value
 * they have when that control is finished executing.  That is how
 * these operations are defined in P4_14.  See
 * https://github.com/p4lang/behavioral-model/blob/master/docs/simple_switch.md#restrictions-on-recirculate-resubmit-and-clone-operations
 * for more details on the current state of affairs.
 *
 * Note 3: There are at least some P4_14 implementations where
 * invoking a generate_digest operation on a field_list will create a
 * message to the control plane that contains the values of those
 * fields when the ingress control is finished executing, which can be
 * different than the values those fields have at the time the
 * generate_digest operation is invoked in the program, if those field
 * values are changed later in the execution of the P4_14 ingress
 * control.
 *
 * The P4_16 plus v1model implementation should always create digest
 * messages that contain the values of the specified fields at the
 * time that the digest extern function is called.  Thus if a P4_14
 * program expecting the behavior described above is compiled using
 * p4c, it may behave differently.

 * mirroring, i.e. zero or more copies of the packet are made, and
 * each will later begin egress processing as an independent packet
 * from the original packet.  The original packet continues with its
 * normal next steps independent of the clone(s).
 *
 * The session parameter is an integer identifying a clone session id
 * (sometimes called a mirror session id).  The control plane software
 * must configure each session you wish to use, or else no clones will
 * be made using that session.  Typically this will involve the
 * control plane software specifying one output port to which the
 * cloned packet should be sent, or a list of (port, egress_rid) pairs
 * to which a separate clone should be created for each, similar to
 * multicast packets.
 *
 * Cloned packets can be distinguished from others by the value of the
 * standard_metadata instance_type field.
 *
 * The caller may request that some user-defined metadata field values
 * from the original packet should be preserved with the cloned
 * packet(s).  The value of the user-defined metadata fields that are
 * preserved with cloned packets is the value they have at the end of
 * ingress or egress processing, not their values at the time the
 * clone3 call is made.  See Note 2 for issues with this.
 *
 * If clone3 is called during ingress processing, the first parameter
 * must be CloneType.I2E.  If clone3 is called during egress
 * processing, the first parameter must be CloneType.E2E.
 *
 * There is no way to undo its effects once it has been called.  If
 * there are multiple calls to clone3 and/or clone during a single
 * execution of the same ingress (or egress) control, only the last
 * clone session and data are used.  See the v1model architecture
 * documentation (Note 1) for more details.

/***
 * Calling assert when the argument is true has no effect, except any

 * below).  If the argument is false, the precise behavior is
 * target-specific, but the intent is to record or log which assert
 * statement failed, and optionally other information about the
 * failure.
 *
 * For example, on the simple_switch target, executing an assert
 * statement with a false argument causes a log message with the file
 * name and line number of the assert statement to be printed, and
 * then the simple_switch process exits.
 *
 * If you provide the --ndebug command line option to p4c when
 * compiling, the compiled program behaves as if all assert statements
 * were not present in the source code.
 *
 * We strongly recommend that you avoid using expressions as an
 * argument to an assert call that can have side effects, e.g. an
 * extern method or function call that has side effects.  p4c will
 * allow you to do this with no warning given.  We recommend this
 * because, if you follow this advice, your program will behave the
 * same way when assert statements are removed.

/***
 * For the purposes of compiling and executing P4 programs on a target
 * device, assert and assume are identical, including the use of the
 * --ndebug p4c option to elide them.  See documentation for assert.
 *
 * The reason that assume exists as a separate function from assert is
 * because they are expected to be used differently by formal
 * verification tools.  For some formal tools, the goal is to try to
 * find example packets and sets of installed table entries that cause
 * an assert statement condition to be false.
 *
 * Suppose you run such a tool on your program, and the example packet
 * given is an MPLS packet, i.e. hdr.ethernet.etherType == 0x8847.
 * You look at the example, and indeed it does cause an assert
 * condition to be false.  However, your plan is to deploy your P4
 * program in a network in places where no MPLS packets can occur.
 * You could add extra conditions to your P4 program to handle the
 * processing of such a packet cleanly, without assertions failing,
 * but you would prefer to tell the tool "such example packets are not
 * applicable in my scenario -- never show them to me".  By adding a
 * statement:
 *
 *     assume(hdr.ethernet.etherType != 0x8847);
 *
 * at an appropriate place in your program, the formal tool should
 * never show you such examples -- only ones that make all such assume
 * conditions true.
 *
 * The reason that assume statements behave the same as assert
 * statements when compiled to a target device is that if the
 * condition ever evaluates to false when operating in a network, it
 * is likely that your assumption was wrong, and should be reexamined.
