# Goals for test cases:

# (1) Include several cases where the current buggy version of the
# compiler causes the wrong transition to occur.

# (2) Include at least two cases that take each of the transitions in
# the correct version of the code, one with all 0s in don't-care bit
# positions of fields, the other with all 1s in don't-care bit
# positions of fields.


# Category (1) tests:

# Confirmed: bug takes transition a2, fix takes a5
packet 0 000000000456 0000022E0000 0000
expect 0 000000000456 0000022E0000 0005

# Confirmed: bug takes transition a3, fix takes a4
packet 0 FFFFFFFFF456 FFFF012FFFFF 0000
expect 0 FFFFFFFFF456 FFFF012FFFFF 0004

# In the bug version, I believe it is impossible to take transition
# a4, because with the bug, the value/mask of a4 matches only a subset
# of packets matched by a3.

# Category (2) tests:

# transition a1
# All bits are exact match in the src and dst, so cannot make two
# different packets for this transition.

# transition a2, as many 1 bits in fields as possible
packet 0 000000000456 FFFF012FFFFF 0000
expect 0 000000000456 FFFF012FFFFF 0002
# We have to make at least one of the bits in the src non-0 to avoid
# taking transition a1 in the correct code.
