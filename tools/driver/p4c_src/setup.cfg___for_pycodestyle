[pycodestyle]
count = False
###     ^^^^^ turned off only because with the statistics enabled,
###           enabling the count output is confusing because it does not come out with a nice prefix such as “total: ”

ignore = E262,E266,E303
### The messages corresponding to the codes for the above-disabled “errors”:
###
###   E262: inline comment should start with '# '
###   E266: too many leading '#' for block comment
###   E303: too many blank lines (3)
###
### Abe disabled E262 and E266 because he thinks it`s nice to use “###” for a real comment, leaving plain “# ” for commented-out code.
###
### Abe disabled E303 because he likes to use blank lines to visually separate conceptually-separate code.
###   Maybe he should use comment lines instead, e.g. “### ——————————————————————————————————————————— ###”?

# max-line-length = 160
###
### Will we allow/permit a much-longer line [in Python files] than the default for “pycodestyle” [around 79 or 80]?
### Abe would be _very_ grateful for a large increase.  ;-)
